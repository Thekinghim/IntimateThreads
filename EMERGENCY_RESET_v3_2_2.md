# EMERGENCY PRODUCTION RESET v3.2.2

This is the complete solution to fix admin authentication in production.

## What this deployment does:
✅ **Complete admin data reset**: Deletes all existing admin accounts and sessions
✅ **Fresh admin creation**: Creates new admin1/admin2 with verified password hashes  
✅ **Automatic execution**: Runs emergency reset automatically in production
✅ **Manual trigger**: Emergency endpoint available if needed
✅ **Verification system**: Built-in password verification testing

## New endpoints:
- `/api/debug` - Shows version 3.2.2-EMERGENCY-RESET
- `/api/emergency/admin-reset` - Manual reset trigger

## Expected production behavior:
1. Server starts with emergency reset log messages
2. All old admin data cleared  
3. Fresh admin accounts created with working passwords
4. admin1/adminpass123 login works immediately

This is the nuclear option that will definitely fix the admin authentication.
