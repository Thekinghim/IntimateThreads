# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client uses **React with TypeScript** built with Vite for fast development and optimized builds. The UI is built with **shadcn/ui components** (based on Radix UI primitives) styled with **Tailwind CSS**. State management is handled through **Zustand** for cart functionality and **TanStack Query** for server state management. Navigation is implemented using **Wouter** (lightweight routing library). The design follows a Nordic aesthetic with custom fonts (Poppins and Lora) and a carefully crafted color scheme featuring warm beige, powder pink, and charcoal tones.

## Backend Architecture
The server runs on **Express.js** with TypeScript, providing RESTful APIs for products, sellers, and orders. The architecture uses a modular storage interface pattern, now implemented with PostgreSQL database storage through the DatabaseStorage class. The server includes comprehensive request logging, error handling middleware, and development-optimized Vite integration for seamless full-stack development.

## Data Storage
The application uses **PostgreSQL** as the primary database with **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database operations. The schema defines three main entities: sellers (Nordic women offering products), products (garments with detailed descriptions), and orders (purchase transactions with payment tracking). Database migrations are managed through Drizzle Kit, and the connection uses Neon Database's serverless driver for cloud-hosted PostgreSQL.

**Recent Changes (Aug 7-8, 2025):**
- Successfully migrated from in-memory storage to PostgreSQL database. Implemented DatabaseStorage class with full relational queries using Drizzle's query API. All relations are properly configured and the database is seeded with sample data. The application now persists data between restarts.
- Implemented secure admin authentication system with bcrypt password hashing and JWT-like session tokens. Created two admin accounts (admin1/admin2) with 7-day session expiration. Admin panel now requires authentication and includes logout functionality.
- Protected all admin API endpoints with authentication middleware. Only authenticated admins can manage orders, create products, and access sensitive business data.
- Enhanced UI design with casual/classy stone and sage color palette for more approachable aesthetic.
- Created comprehensive Shopify-style admin panel with dashboard, order management, product catalog, and seller management.
- Integrated 17track for professional package tracking with real-time updates from any carrier worldwide.
- Fixed page navigation scrolling issue - pages now automatically scroll to top when navigating.
- Added dual tracking functionality: Nordic Collection order lookup and universal package tracking.
- Complete luxury transformation of entire application with sophisticated Nordic-inspired color palette. Implemented premium glass morphism effects, luxury gradients, refined shadows, and elegant typography throughout all components. Enhanced navbar, footer, admin login, home page, and admin panel with high-end aesthetic including custom CSS utilities for luxury styling. Application now features premium Nordic cream, dusty rose, sage mist, and deep charcoal color scheme with smooth animations and refined interactions.

## Authentication and Payment Processing
The application integrates with **NOWPayments** for cryptocurrency transactions (Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT), **Revolut** for traditional payments, and **Gumroad** as an additional payment gateway. No traditional user authentication is implemented - the system operates on anonymous purchasing with email-based order tracking. Payment status tracking includes pending, completed, failed, and expired states with corresponding order status management.

## Development and Deployment
The build process uses **Vite** for frontend bundling and **esbuild** for server compilation. The application is configured for both development (with hot module replacement) and production deployment. Environment-specific configurations handle database connections, payment API keys, and service URLs. The TypeScript configuration ensures type safety across the shared schema between client and server.
